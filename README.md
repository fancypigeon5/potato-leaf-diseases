# potato-leaf-diseases
## Dataset Content
(The dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/potato-leaf-disease-dataset/data] contains 3076 images taken in different conditions. Each image is in one of 7 health conditions: fungi, viruses, pests, bacteria, Phytophthora, nematodes and healthy.
For this Project we will be focussing on the 3 categories that are most important for Agriplex Farms (bacteria, Phytophthora and healthy)


## Business Requirements
Agriplex Farms is a mid-sized agricultural company specializing in growing and supplying potatoes to local and international markets. Over the past few years, the farm has faced significant challenges in maintaining the health of its crops due to various diseases affecting their potato plants, Caused by bacteria and phytophthora. These diseases, if left untreated, can devastate yields, resulting in financial losses and disrupted supply chains.

Currently, disease detection is carried out manually by agronomists walking through fields to inspect crops. This process is time-intensive and prone to human error. As a result, Agriplex Farms has identified an urgent need for a faster, more accurate, and scalable solution to detect diseases early, enabling timely interventions.

Agriplex Farms envisions leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to revolutionize their disease detection process. By deploying an ML-powered solution, the farm aims to:

- The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy potato leaf from both disease causes.
- The client is interested in predicting whether a potato leaf is healthy or diseased, and if diseased, identifying the specific disease present.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks

### Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization
- We will display the mean and standard deviation images for healthy and diseased potato leaves.
- We will display the visual difference between average healthy and diseased potato leaves.
- We will create an image montage showcasing various healthy and diseased leaves, including examples of different disease types.

### Business Requirement 2: Classification
- We want to predict if a given potato leaf is healthy or diseased.
- We want to identify specific diseases if a potato leaf is classified as diseased.
- We will build a multi-class classifier to identify if a leaf is healthy or identify the disease.


## ML Business Case

### PotatoDiseaseDetection
- We want an ML model to predict whether a potato leaf is healthy or diseased. If diseased, the model should classify the specific type of disease.
- This is a supervised, multi-class, single-label classification problem.
- Our ideal outcome is to provide farm managers and agronomists with a faster and more reliable method for detecting potato diseases, enabling timely interventions and reducing crop losses.
- The model success metrics are:
    - F1-score of 85% or above for each class in multi-class classification.
    - A weighted average of 90% or better on the test set
- The model output is defined as a multiclass indicating the disease (or healthy) and the associated probabilities for each class. The prediction should enable real-time analysis of field images, therefore not in batches.

- Heuristics: Currently, disease identification relies on manual inspection by agronomists walking through fields. This process involves collecting leaf samples, visually examining them for discoloration, spots, or texture changes, and identifying diseases based on expertise. This method is time-intensive, error-prone, and not scalable across thousands of acres, leading to delayed responses and increased crop losses.

- Training Data:
The training data to fit the model comes from kaggle. This dataset contains images of potato leaves, labeled with the disease. Augmented versions of these images (e.g., flipped, rotated, adjusted brightness) are used to improve model robustness.

- Train data
    - target: healthy or disease type (multi-class label).
    - Features: images of potato leaves, including variations due to lighting, angles, and field conditions.


## Dashboard Design
### Page 1: Project Summary

- Project Summary
    - General Information
        - Potato diseases such as late blight, early blight, and bacterial black spot significantly threaten global potato production.
        - These diseases can cause discoloration, spotting, and texture changes in potato leaves, leading to reduced crop yield and financial losses for farmers.
        - Currently, disease detection involves manual inspection by agronomists, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable across large plantations.
        - Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial to reduce crop losses and optimize resource use, such as pesticides.
    - Project Dataset
        - The dataset contains thousands of labeled images of potato leaves, each image is labeled as healthy or a specific disease category.
        - Augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments) are applied to enhance the datasetâ€™s variability and improve model robustness.
    - Business Requirements
        - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate between healthy and diseased potato leaves.
        - The client is interested in building a machine learning model to predict if a potato leaf is healthy or diseased and if diseased, the specific type of disease.

## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/
